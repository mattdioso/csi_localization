# AR CSI Localization
---
This project contains a Android SDK project that leverages Google ARCore to help the user determine the dimensions (L, W, H) of the environment they're in. It was originally developed for a Samsung Galaxy S8 running Android 9.

The application presents the user with an interactive view of the world through their camera lens and allows them to place anchors at key corners (vanishing points) in the room from which it will use to calculate dimensions.
