#CSI demo
---
This subfolder contains scripts used in a demo given to students on how to capture and process CSI data.

Sample CSI data captures were performed on the ASUS WiFi6 router to produce .pcap files which were then converted to .mat files using scripts provided by the AX-CSI team.

These .mat files were then pre-processed to extract the CSI information and then plotted on a 2D graph to demonstrate uniqueness and different locations in a room.
